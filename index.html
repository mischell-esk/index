Cacao was worshiped by the Mayans, fueled the daily diet of<br> the Aztecs, and has been labeled the "food of the gods" by many<br> subsequent cultures. It makes sense, because it tastes as good as it<br> makes you feel.<br><br>

		  			Mind / Tryptophan is an essential amino acid that serves several important<br> purposes, like nitrogen balance in adults and growth in infants. It also creates<br> niacin, which is essential in creating the neurotransmitter serotonin.

		  			#1 COFFEE ALTERNATIVE
		  		</p>
		  		<h1 class="container-eleven__title2">
		  			We weren’t mad at coffee,<br> just disappointed.
		  		</h1>
		  		<p class="container-eleven__content2">
		  			I fell into the commonly held belief that coffee would allow me to do<br> more and do it better. Soon, I was drinking 3 cups of coffee per day<br> and began to experience anxiety, jitters and really poor sleep which<br> led to a variety of other negative side effects.<br><br>

					It turns out caffeine blocks the adenosine receptors affecting your<br> ability to get deep sleep. In addition, the jolt of adrenaline and<br> manipulation of your dopamine cause the shakes, crash and<br> dependency which is terrible for high performance in the office or at<br> the gym.<br><br>

					I decided I no longer wanted to rely on  hundreds of milligrams of<br> caffeine to wake up the same way that I didn’t want to depend on a<br> pill to fall asleep. I loved the morning ritual, but I felt like if I was<br> going to drink something every morning, it should be more than just a<br> vessel for caffeine. So, I set out to make something better.<br><br>

		  			Q&A
		  		</h1>
		  		<p class="container-thirteen__content">
		  			<strong><br><br>DOES IT CONTAIN CAFFEINE?<br><br></strong>

					Yes, there is about 1/7 the caffeine of a cup of coffee in mud.<br> This comes as a part of the Black Tea Leaves found in the<br>Masala Chai. Just enough to provide some alertness without<br> creating dependency.<br><br>

					<strong><br>WHERE IS IT MADE?<br></strong>

					The ingredients of Mud are sourced from the best places on<br> the planet. All the ingredients are brought together and<br> packaged up for you in Venice, CA.<br><br>

					<strong><br>CAN YOU DRINK WHILE PREGNANT?<br></strong>

					Though our ingredients are all associated with profound<br> health benefits, we suggest consulting with your physician<br> before making any changes to your diet during pregnancy.<br><br>

					<strong><br>DO YOU OFFER SAMPLES?<br></strong>

					At the moment, we do not. Our product is expensive to create<br> and we believe that you will not regret ordering it to try<br> for yourself.

		  	</div>
		  	<div class="container-fourteen">
		  		<p class="container-fourteen__content">
		  			<strong><br>WILL IT MAKE ME TRIP?<br></strong>

					Mud contains magic mushrooms, but not those kind :)<br> Nothing in mud would cause a psychidellic trip, but if you are<br> into that sort of thing, we suggest you look into the work<br> being done by www.maps.org. We donate to them every month.<br><br>

					<strong><br>IS THERE SUGAR IN IT?<br></strong>

					There is zero sugar in mud and no sweeteners added.<br><br>
					<strong><br>WHERE ARE YOUR MUSHROOMS FROM?<br></strong>

					All of our ingredients are 100% organic. We source our<br> mushrooms from Om Mushrooms in Carlsbad California as<br> and mycelial biomass cultured on Organic Oats.<br><br>

					<strong><br>DO YOU HAVE WHOLESALE PARTNERS?<br></strong>

					Yes, we work with select cafe and markets that we feel<br> represent our brand and serve our customers well. If you are<br> interested in our wholesale program please reach out to drink@mudwtr.com.
